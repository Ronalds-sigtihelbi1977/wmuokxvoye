Just walked out of G20, feeling like I've been hit by a tornado made of political jargon and action set pieces. My back's killing me from those seats, I swear they were designed by someone who hates spines. Popcorn crumbs everywhere; they infest like ants. 

The movie opens loud, like louder-than-your-neighbor's-dog daily barking kind of loud. Explosions paired with speeches, so many speeches, but somehow it works? It’s like watching a bunch of world leaders try to cook dinner together and somehow not burn down the kitchen. Kind of reminded me of that time my uncle tried to fix a blender with a hammer—it shouldn't work, but it does in a chaotic kinda way. Someone told me to download the movie for later, catch all the bits I missed while spilling soda on my shoe. 

> Man, there was this one scene where they flipped from a heated argument in the war room to a car chase across some European city. Wheels screeching like a bad Pepsi commercial from the 90s. I'm convinced they filmed that chase on a different planet where gravity just doesn’t apply the same way. It’s surreal, like dreaming you're in a game of chess but the pieces are running away. 

It's half political drama, half action movie, and I guess a quarter motivational speech? My head’s still buzzing. There was this powerful monologue, I think the President or maybe it was the Secretary of, I dunno, Agriculture? Whoever they were, they said something so profound but I only remember the last word: paperclip. I mean, who ends a speech with that? The audio drowned in the guy next to me crunching his chips louder than the explosions.

Watch the movie if you can, maybe with subtitles so you can also hear the dialogue over the action. Pretty sure I missed half of it because of my own stupid clumsiness with the popcorn. Chair was squeaking every time I shifted, like an old door in a horror movie, distracting me every bit.

Don’t ask me who was double-crossing who; it’s like trying to untangle Christmas tree lights after an earthquake. You come out remembering fragments, like fragments of a dream mixed with the dim theater lights and the soda-stained floor now etched in my mind like a weird Jackson Pollock piece.
